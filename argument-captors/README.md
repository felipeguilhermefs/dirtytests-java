# Argument Captors

This repository is a part of a system that generates invoices with discounts.

Make the test clean and remove the argument captors:

- why would the programmer have decided to use argument captors here?
- what alternatives do you see?

## Tips:

- To achieve really clean tests, you might need to refactor the
production code a bit as well.
- If you want to quickly add a toString and/or equals/hashCode to the event
class, you can use the @ToString and @EqualsAndHashCode annotations from the
Lombok library
